  - > Hackerman

Any system, any time; full penetration, right through protection. You
gain a +3 bonus to attempts made to access secured electronic systems.

*Prerequisites: 6 Smarts*

  - > Meltdown

When avoiding being caught simply isn’t enough. If you have successfully
accessed a computer system, you may spend 30 seconds per level of
security rating doing irrevocable damage to that computer, preventing it
from ever being useful again.

*Prerequisites: Hackerman*

  - > Backdoor

Everything is connected, at least to some extent. After successfully
gaining access to a computer system, you also gain limited access to any
system that could be reasonably linked to that system, with the
exception of power distribution.

*Prerequisites: Hackerman, 8 Smarts*

  - > Metalhead

At their core, droids and other mechanical systems are beholden to a set
of rules that makes them predictable, a fact you have learned to take
advantage of. You gain +2 AC when dodging attacks from droids, and +1 to
hit against them. If you have Hackerman, you also gain an additional +2
bonus when attempting to access a droid’s systems, and are able to do so
as a 4 shot action in combat.

*Prerequisites: 7 Smarts*

  - > Fly on the Wall

After accessing a communications or surveillance system, you may make a
Smarts check to establish a hidden relay within the system that forwards
anything it records from then on to you. You must be within at least 1
AU to access or download the information. Those interacting with it make
an opposed Smarts check against the check initially made when planting
the relay.
