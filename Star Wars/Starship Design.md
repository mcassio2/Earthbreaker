**Starship Design**


***Resources***

Starships have two resources during design; space and power. Space is restricted based on hull class, while power’s only restriction is it’s generator, as well as how much power that generator takes. Some modifications may be done to increase spacing or decrease power usage; these usually cost neither space nor power, and instead have an up front monetary cost. The cheaper variants usually come with some concern of failure in the future. Smaller ships tend to always be short on one or the other, while larger ships need to find complicated utility modules to utilize what is available to them.

**Ship Sizing**


|*Size*|*Space Given*|*Default Cargo Space*|*Base Price*|*Base Stats*|
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
|Frigate|100|100 tn|2500|3/6/2/0|
|Destroyer|250|500 tn|12500|4/6/2/0|
|Cruiser|500|1000 tn|35000|5/5/2/0|
|Battlecruiser|2000|2500 tn|75000|6/4/3/0|
|Battleship|4000|10000 tn|175000|7/3/3/0|
|Capital|7500|25000 tn|450000|9/2/4/0|
|Dreadnought|15000|75000 tn|1000000|11/1/5/0|
|Station|25000|200000 tn|4250000|15/0/7/0|


Cargo space may be converted to open space at a rate of 2:1 (cargo space to open space). This ratio is caused by the added need for power lines, reinforced bulkheads, and lack of perfect efficiency during the refit. Likewise, open space may be converted to cargo space at a 2:1 ratio (open space to cargo space), though this refit takes quite a bit longer. Cargo ships start with 10 times the cargo space value and ⅓ the open space value. Cargo ships cannot convert cargo space to open space outside of a dock, and do so at a 20:1 ratio (cargo space to open space).

\*May have more than one. May also include alongside other generators.

\*\* Failure of this generator causes the unequivocal destruction of the ship and the loss of all those on board. May seriously damage those nearby.

***Ship Components***

Ship components fall into four categories; weapons, propulsion, shields, and miscellaneous components. Miscellaneous components are the only ones that do not necessarily scale in cost with size. Weapons are either pilot manned, meaning the gun is in a fixed position and the ship itself must be maneuvered with a pilot check to make the shot, or in a turret position, requiring someone else to man the gun to make the shot. Propulsion is broken down into sub-light and hyperspace speeds, with sublight being your in combat speed and hyperspace being your out of combat speed. Shields provide temporary health, and regenerate based on the rolls of whoever is manning them.

**\*\* Second number indicates price of ammunition** 

**\*\*\* Deals half damage to crew, penetrating shields**

**\*\*\*\* Gains +2 to hit after landing a successful hit**

Weapons scale upwards as sizes increase. Component size categories are as follows:

-- **Light:** Frigate, Destroyer

-- **Medium:** Cruiser, Battlecruiser

**-- Heavy:** Battleship, Capital

-- **Super:** Dreadnought, Station.

The prices and resource costs listed above are the Light variants for all weapons. When adding these weapons to a ship within a different component size category, they scale according to the table below. Additionally, all weapons receive a penalty or bonus to hit according to size differences. For every step smaller that a ship is from your own, you receive a -2 to hit. Likewise, for every step larger that a ship’s weapons is from your own, you gain a +2 bonus to hit. For example, a Mon Calamari Cruiser, which is a capital ship, receives a -4 to hit when targeting a TIE fighter with its Heavy weapons. Likewise, that TIE fighter receives a +4 to hit the Mon Calamari Cruiser.

|**Medium**|x2|x3|x2|x3|
|**Heavy**|x4|x6|x3|x5|
|**Super**|x8|x9|x5|x10|

**Shields**

Shields provide temporary hp depending on size, power consumed, and regenerative systems. Different manufacturers have created a variety of shield systems with individual focuses. Shields are modular, and are not scaled to size; what is listed is what you get. Shields do not have to be active to regenerate health; an unpowered shield still undergoes the maitenance required to regain integrity. You may have multiple shield units active on the same ship, but having more than one active increases their power requirement by x0.5 per active shield unit. Most designers integrate multiple shield units but keep some dormant until others are penetrated, allowing the others time to regenerate in a passive mode rather than simply stacking all of them at once. Once shields have been completely depleted, a series of three engineering checks must be made to bring them back online. If successful, the shields return at half health with half of their starting regeneration value.

**Propulsion**

Propulsion is divided into two sections, in and out of system. In system drives are measured by meters per second, with a conversion of 500 m/ps being 1 tile on a grid map, in addition to their adjustments to maneuverability. Out of system propulsion is measured by a coefficient adjustment, with higher multipliers being worse. There are also navigation and maneuvering systems that can affect both of these within the miscellaneous section. Propulsion systems scale in cost according to the scaling table defined by the weapons section.

***Heavy Modifications***

This category covers major overhauls to the structure or modules of a ship, ones that usually have a significant cost of one type or another attached. Many of these modify the frame of the ship, and some are, resultantly, incompatible with each other. 



|*Name*|*Cost*|Description|
| :-: | :-: | :-: |
|Armor Plating|50 space/1 Durability (scales), 1250 credits per 1 Durability (scales)|Adds damage reduction in increments of 5 to the ship. Damage reduction takes place after any damage done to shields. Double effect against mass drivers|
|Reinforced Bulkheads|¼ available space, 50x that amount in credits|Doubles the HP of any ship it is applied to|
|Anti-Boarding Systems|1/10 available space, 25 power (scales), 7500 credits (scales)|Adds automated defenses (blaster turrets, blast doors, pitfalls or energy prisons) at checkpoints throughout the ship. Systems can be assisted by a manned console, but do not need to be. Also adds camera feeds of all rooms to cockpit console.|
|Oversized Weapons|Triples the power, space, and credit cost of the modified weapon|Causes the modified weapon to act as if it were one size category larger. Cannot be applied to Dreadnoughts or Stations.|
|Overpowered Engines|Double the power cost of the modified engines|Doubles the movement provided by a set of engines, but entirely removes it’s maneuvering bonus.|
|Power System Overdrives|1/10 available space, 5000 credits (scales)|Increase available power by 1.5x. Any time a system is disabled, the power has a ½ chance of failing entirely, requiring three engineering checks to bring back online.|
|Gun Wings|5000 credits per weapon added (scales)|Adds an external ship mount for a weapon, as well as the space required to house it. The weapon mount may be targeted separate from the ship and destroyed.|


**Computer Systems**

Starships require a number of different computing systems in order to function, but there are also a number of voluntary add-on systems that can allow for increased functionality in other areas. Many captains opt for a basic computing package, favoring whatever comes standard with their ship due to cost, but those seeking conflict must often choose to upgrade their computers in order to handle the strain that combat places upon them.
