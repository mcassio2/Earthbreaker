  - > Organized

Everything in its place, and nothing will be forgotten. You do not lose
items, and retrieving things from your belongings no longer takes time
during combat. This lowers the shot cost of drinking potions by 1, and
otherwise nullifies the costs of any retrieval action.

  - > Know Thy Enemy

To defeat an enemy, first, you must know them. You may make a Smarts
check to identify an enemy as a 1 shot action. Doing so makes you aware
of their stats and any exceptional talents or abilities they may
possess.

  - > Healthy

Power and vigor course through you; your hold on life is strong indeed.
You gain +3 to your maximum HP. You may take this talent up to three
times. If you do, the second time grants you an additional +6, rather
than +3, and the third time grants you +9, rather than +3.

  - > Quick Recovery

Your body recovers quickly, much faster than most others. Instead of
requiring 3 successful death saving throws to recover, you require only
2.

  - > Special: Aggressive Pacifism

Your culture prizes self defense, but *will not* strike the first blow.
You may not take hostile action against a target unless forced to do so,
either by their own hostile action or secondary circumstances. Failure
to uphold this condition will result in exile from Chiss culture.
