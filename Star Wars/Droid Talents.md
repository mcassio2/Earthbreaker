  - > Droid Immunities

Being a metal man has itâ€™s perks. You are immune to bleeding, poisons,
disease, mental persuasion, and any other effect that relies on a flesh
and blood body.

  - > Computer Interface

Computer access comes easier to some than others. For you, it might as
well be talking. You gain a +4 bonus to all checks made to hack or
manipulate computers.

  - > Energized

No sleeping leaves quite a lot of time to get things done. You only have
to rest once every 120 hours, and only for a 1 hour period. However,
this rest must occur at a charging station. If you are unable to make it
to a charging station, you shut down, rendered effectively unconscious,
until you are taken to a charging station and receive 2 hours to charge.

  - > Computerized Reflexes

You may add half your smarts to dodge attempts, as well as to Dexterity
checks made to avoid incoming damage.
