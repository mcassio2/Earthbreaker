**<span class="underline">Ahranoworm</span>\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_**

A massive, 15-meter long worm, bulging with muscle and veins, baring
nearly a dozen eyes, burrowing through the earth. It converts sediment
into nutrition, but is just as capable of devouring flesh with it’s
massive molar-like teeth.

  - > Health-focused creature of higher CR

  - > Will retreat when below 1/4th health, attempting to drag the
    > weakest target along with it.
    
      - > Opposed Health check, usually favoring it.

  - > Focuses on constant reposition with burrowing tactics
    
      - > Will usually target the physically weakest specimen based on
        > appearance and threat level.
    
      - > An observant opponent can sense it’s movements, and gains a
        > free attack upon reappearance.

**<span class="underline">Chrysalid</span>*\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_***

A strange, crystalline being, varying in specific shape depending on
strength and focus. Generally speaking, these beings are arachinoid in
appearance, bearing eight legs and a pincer. Some variants boast a
nearly impressive intelligence, and some level of psychic aptitude,
though most are merely mindless pawns protecting a hive. All are usually
heavily armored, with crystalline chitin protecting their innards.

  - > Health focused creature of varying CR

  - > Meant to be a main focus of a session/multiple sessions

  - > Does not retreat, sacrificing their own lives for their hive

  - > Comes in many variations, with some even flying
    
      - > Mactera variations have glowing puss nodules, which
        > intelligent players can target for double damage
    
      - > Exploding variants deal flat damage, and have negligible
        > health (excepting detonators.)
    
      - > In addition to slashers (offense focused) and tanks (defense
        > focused), there exists the rare praetor, the advanced grunt
        > archetype that combines the defensive qualities of the tank
        > and the offensive qualities of the slasher. These almost
        > always accompany Detonators and Dreadnoughts, though they can
        > occasionally spawn on their own

  - > Larger specimens, such as the Detonator or Dreadnought, do not
    > actually lack dexterity, despite being physically large and
    > imposing
    
      - > Despite this, both boast a ½ movement speed, for balance
        > purposes

**<span class="underline">Earth
Dragon</span>\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_**

A massive, dirt-covered creature, brown in hue, and generally angry.
They tend to live deep underground, preferring cavernous expanses to the
wide open territories above. The dirt and stone that covers them has
been molded on during their travels, a side effect of using corrosive
acids to burrow through the earth. Said acids are highly potent, capable
of dissolving normal steel in mere seconds. The children of this variant
are more aggressive than most, actively attacking those it finds in it’s
home. The infants are barely capable of producing acids, but, due to a
lack of control, dump their entire supply instantly, creating an effect
similar to that of an elder Earth Dragon.

  - > Health/Attunement focused creature of significant CR

  - > Capable of burrowing constantly, moving underground to distract
    > and confound opponents.

  - > Elder dragons possess extremely acidic bile, which they may
    > project at will at a cost of 4 shots. This bile turns squares into
    > damaging and slowing hazards, dealing 1/4th the initial damage of
    > the breath weapon to those who pass through or end their turn in
    > the affected squares. These squares also require double movement
    > to walk through.
    
      - > Younger variants possess only one charge of the potent breath
        > weapon, though it deals damage equivalent to the elder
        > dragons.
