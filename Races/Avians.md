**Variants**

**Racial Talents**

*Flight:* Avians possess flight, powered by a set of wings, usually
spanning about 12 ft. If the space they inhabit does not allow for their
wings to spread, they are unable to fly. Fly speed is equivalent to
ground speed, and must account for vertical movement, as well.

*Talons:* Knives for toes have some advantages. You deal an additional
+3 damage with unarmed strikes.

*Acrobatics:* You gain a +2 bonus on acrobatic maneuvers (jumping,
tumbling, wall-running, etc).

*Improved Observation:* Your skill in perception has improved, and it
shows. You gain a +2 to observation, and can see twice as far in the
darkness.

*Pack Mentality:* Your place is among your friends; as long as you are
with them, you will always prevail. As long as you have a friendly
target in melee range, you gain a +1 to all rolls. This bonus increases
for each additional friendly target in melee with you.
