  - > Basic Antimagic; Dispel Magic

You disrupt and sap the magical energies affecting a target of your
choice, destroying any magical function it may have. To activate this
ability, make an attunement check at a 3 shot cost, opposed by an
attunement check from the creator of whichever magical effect you are
attempting the counter. If the effect is, for whatever reason, latent,
it uses the attunement check made when the effect was first established.
If you are successful, the magical effect ends immediately, as do any of
its secondary effects.
