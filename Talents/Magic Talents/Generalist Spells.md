Generalists spells are those spells that, due to their simplistic
nature, can come from a variety of sources, rather than a single school.
Those taking them may provide their own explanation for the way the
effects of the spell are accomplished.

  - > Haste

A burst of speed, celerity of mind and body. A nearly universal boon. To
cast this spell, make an Attunement check, DC 8, at a 3 shot cost. If
successful, the target of your choice reduces the shot cost of all
actions taken by 1. Additionally, you gain a +4 bonus to dodge attempts.
This cannot reduce the shots required to take an action below 1.
Movement no longer costs any shots whatsoever. This spell lasts as long
as you are able to concentrate on it. Concentrating on maintaining the
spell imposes a -4 penalty to Attunement as long as it is active.

  - > Prestidigitation

The kingpin of parlor tricks, this spell allows the caster to perform a
nearly limitless number of small deeds. Usage requires an Attunement
check, DC 3. The actual effects are always minor, but are too numerous
to list. Common uses include recoloring items, cleaning, very minor (and
temporary) illusions, assisting in the preparation of food, and many
similar effects. Notably, it cannot be used offensively in any way.
