  - > Basic Psychic Proficiency: Mindreader

The minds of others are an open book, easily read with the right tools.
To cast this spell, make an Attunement check, DC 5 (or opposed by a
Smarts check if the opponent is aware of the spell being cast), at a
2-shot cost. If successful, you are able to read a single target's
surface thoughts. A target trained in resisting mindreading can attempt
to withhold certain information, making a Smarts check after the spell
is successfully cast opposed by your own Smarts check. If they succeed,
they keep specific information from you, specified before the check is
made.

  - > Empathy

Once a basic understanding of mindreading is achieved, it becomes much
easier to grab simpler information. You are permanently able to read the
basic emotions of those within sight.

  - > Mindspike

A sudden burst of incoherent, disorienting thought overwhelms the
target, injuring them mentally. Make an attunement attack, basic DC 6,
at a 3-shot cost. If successful, the target takes 7 damage bypassing
armor <span class="underline">that cannot be magically healed</span>. If
the target's hp is depleted by this attack, they either go insane,
shutting down as a person, or enter a coma; thr choice is yours.
