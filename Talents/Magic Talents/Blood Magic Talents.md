  - > Blood Bolt

Deals 3d6 damage per success (measured in increments of 20) to a target
of your choice, an assault fueled by the blood of the fallen. May only
be used if a living target has died during the current shot order.
Additionally, the caster regains 1d4 HP per success (measured in
increments of 10), which may not exceed the damage dealt. If the caster
is at their maximum HP, they instead gain temporary HP. This temporary
HP may not exceed half of their maximum HP.
