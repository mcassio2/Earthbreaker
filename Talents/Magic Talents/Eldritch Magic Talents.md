  - > Basic Eldritch Magic: Revelation from Beyond

Knowledge beyond reason and abhorrent to sanity is shared, leaving the
victim changed. To use this ability, make a Smarts check at a 3 shot
cost, DC 5. If successful, the target must likewise make the same smarts
check, at a -4 penalty. If they fail, the cosmic truths revealed to them
fracture their psyche, rendering them unable to act on their next turn,
and forcing them to spend 3 shots. Those with ANY Eldritch Magic talents
are immune to this ability.

  - > Grasp of the Stars

Dark forces are called upon to bind and assault your enemy, pulling them
ever further into the grasp of the Old Ones. To use this ability, make a
Smarts check at a 4 shot cost. If successful, dark black tentacles rise
from the ground around a target of your choice, encircling them. The
target may make a Health or Dexterity check to escape once per turn;
doing so costs 2 shots. If they are unsuccessful, they remain bound, and
take 2d8 damage. If the target is bound for 3 turns, the tentacles begin
infiltrating their body, making escape near impossible (granting a -30
penalty to escape checks). Additionally, as long as the tentacles are
infiltrating the body, the target takes a stacking 1d6 penalty to Smarts
checks on each of their turns. The tentacles are capable of taking
damage, and possess 20 HP/0 Armor. Those bound may not attack them.
Tentacles are not subject to AOE damage unless the victim is, as well.
