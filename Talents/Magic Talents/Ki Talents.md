  - > Basic Ki Talent: Meditation

Usage of one’s Ki requires a centered mind and body, a state which
begins with meditation. To use this ability, make a Smarts check, with a
+10 bonus for each previous day you successfully meditated. If you fail
to maintain a streak, the bonus resets to 0. If you are currently
suffering from a persistent detrimental effect, each day that you
meditate, you may make a save against it, determined by the effect you
are suffering from.

  - > Martial Discipline

The path to mastery of one’s self first requires fully owning one’s
body. You gain a +5 bonus to all combat rolls involving physical effort.
Additionally, while a shot order is active, you gain a +5 bonus to
smarts checks.

  - > Mental Mastery

True mental discipline requires deep levels of introspection, something
you have finally learned. You gain a +10 bonus to Smarts saves, as well
as a +10 bonus to observation and tracking checks. Additionally, you now
possess a trained photographic memory, remembering anything you
purposefully commit to memory.

  - > Iron Palm

Much training and many hurt knuckles has resulted in a set of hands that
can break wrought stone with ease. Resultantly, your unarmed strikes
bypass 2d8 points of armor on each attack.
