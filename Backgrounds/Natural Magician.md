Natural Magician

Some are borne with a natural aptitude for magic, and find themselves
casting from even a young age. Often times, these magicians are lacking
formal training, but find it extremely easy to manipulate magical energy
in simple ways. Most of them find they lean towards a particular school,
and can pull from that domain quite easily, while other types of magic
are foreign and difficult. Depending on the direction their magical
focus takes, those gifted in such a way can take vastly different roads,
some quite dangerous. It is very common to see the naturally gifted
among adventuring parties, blasting the party’s enemies with gouts of
flame or tending the wounds of the injured. Many parties seek them out,
knowing that even without experience, these mages bear exceptional
talent, and will only grow in power with time.
