Wild Child

Raised wild, either by choice or by circumstance, this character has a
different outlook and skill set than most would assume at first glance.
They are often well versed in wilderness survival, and have a more
savage view of civilization. Many find it difficult to integrate within
a normal party, as their way of solving problems can often cause
difficulties for themselves and others. Regardless, they are a valuable
asset to have, being strong in both body and spirit.

You gain a +2 bonus to Health and a -1 to Smarts during character
creation.

Wild Children gain the following gear

  - > 1 common weapon of your choice worth less than 75 gold

  - > 1 common value dagger

  - > 1 set of camping supplies

  - > 1 poor quality pack

You gain either Two Handed Specialization, Animal Friend, or Unnatural
Perception as a bonus talent. You may select two additional talents, but
they must be drawn either from Health, Dexterity, or Smarts.

You are peerless in your natural environment, the apex predator of your
food chain. While within an environment similar to the one you were
raised in, you leave no tracks, gain a +4 bonus to foraging, tracking,
and stealth, and are able to discern additional information from your
environment.
