Feyborne Subtypes

**Carbuncle**

*Talent:* Cure Bodily Ailment

*Special:* The gem in the Carbuncle’s head is crystalline dragon’s
blood. It still possesses some small semblance of the dragon’s great
knowledge. Once per day, a carbuncle may ask the gem one question, which
the gem will answer to the best of its abilities.

**Season Spirit**

Stats: 4/6/5/8

Talent: Weather Control

*Special:* Season Spirits are most powerful when in their own season,
and at their weakest just before it. When it is the appropriate season
for the Season Spirit, they gain a +2 bonus to all Attunement checks,
and Weather Control no longer requires a roll. While in the season
before theirs, they instead get a -1 to all Attunement checks, and are
unable to use Weather Control.
